    <h1>“Hope” is the thing with feathers</h1>
    <p>“Hope” is the thing with feathers
    <br>That perches in the soul
    <br>And sings the tune without the words
    <br>And never stops - at all<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    <br>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard
    <br>And sore must be the storm
    <br>That could abash the little Bird
    <br>That kept so many warm<br>

        Nobody’s born smart. We <strong>all</strong> start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong><em>Thankfully </em>we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <em>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.</em><br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
